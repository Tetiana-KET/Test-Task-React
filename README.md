### Quiz app

Create a Quiz component, and use it in an AppComponent.

The component should accept the list of questions that are on the page below
`<quiz questions={questions} />`

When a correct answer is selected, it will turn green, when an incorrect answer is selected, it will turn red. At the end, it should show how many answers out of 3 were correct.

The design of the component is to repeat from the screenshot.
